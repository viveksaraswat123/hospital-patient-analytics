Power BI dashboard analyzing hospital patient data (2019–2024)
🏥 Hospital Patient Analytics Dashboard (2019–2024)

This is a Power BI project I created while learning data visualization and dashboarding. It uses hospital data to show trends, patterns, and insights in patient admissions, treatments, and medical conditions over the last few years.
